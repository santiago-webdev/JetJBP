# JetJBP
A basic colorscheme for personal use.

## Palette
_Still a work in progress, I'll probably change the colors to something else._

## Installation
### Neovim
You can follow the instructions
[there](https://github.com/santigo-zero/jetjbp.nvim).

### Plasma and Konsole
Manually choose JetJBP in your settings after running the script.

### Kitty
Run the script and then add this line to your kitty.conf:
```bash
include themes/JetJBP.conf
```

### WezTerm
Run the script and then require the theme:
```lua
colors = require('themes.jetjbp')
```

### Firefox
For firefox you need to install [this extension from
mozilla](https://color.firefox.com/) and then follow this
[link](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAI2AQAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCia3ftKEGccwS-xMDPr8cAKwEt0OXLENWQmRohVZ6vhiqQNikX1OhVQRk5tIIgS0T8SDPojkQju6ipT13ZMiAPvPblOfu__IMXn_M0zAluDaK5aCszuckrNTBVh9cOx9tjKCg3WcpqYcIpLfYssSntJNXO9_kBxbJlggVs_fADnDzbz4rddsxM5GRTgv7tKIhlwa2jLzPaH_d2lqv5fDwzhtgLjIOqWTtr-QRMJ5788xhNnnHWJw9JL9jsNu),
I'll eventually stop using this method and package the colorscheme as a
standalone extension, but for that to happen I need to settle down with the
colors I want to use first.
