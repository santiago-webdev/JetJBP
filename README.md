# JetJBP
A basic colorscheme for personal use.

## Palette
_Still a work in progress, I'll probably change the colors to something else._

## Installation
### Neovim
You can follow the instructions
[there](https://github.com/santigo-zero/jetjbp.nvim).

### Plasma and Konsole
Manually choose JetJBP in your settings after running the script.

### Kitty
Run the script and then add this line to your kitty.conf:
```bash
include themes/JetJBP.conf
```

### WezTerm
Run the script and then require the theme:
```lua
colors = require('themes.jetjbp')
```

### Firefox
For firefox you need to install [this extension from
mozilla](https://color.firefox.com/) and then follow this
[link](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAI2AQAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCia3ftKEGccwS-xMDPr7OiSwEt0MiI9hsc5ajjvQ2Qc5ssvf4Cv5XvaGvWlfUDhu6NyjdA1FEH20sCnAHqidW7c_enXIkDTTbEZ-l7dpyFkC_0x1derv6qU4Kv6Cuzh-hozdlnGx4ex2vsQuw_PypM-T1chKDs4BrasqciXlXueUi99gJBAn5UQsJwuFo2uhnQy5sxv3uyGCU44t-GJdkf9jHSSxO1W42k3vf7Uw-lcu01dzbeogZ5s2490Lyvm42cA),
I'll eventually stop using this method and package the colorscheme as a
standalone extension, but for that to happen I need to settle down with the
colors I want to use first.
