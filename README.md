"Plasma and Konsole using the JetJBP colorscheme")

# Installation
**WIP**
Each program except neovim has a script to install the colorscheme for it, but these
"installers" just copy the files and you need to choose the colorscheme
yourself.

## Neovim

## Plasma and Konsole
Clean all settings windows and manually choose JetJBP in your settings after
running the script.

## Kitty
Add this line anywhere in your kitty.conf after running the script(WIP):
```bash
include themes/JetJBP.conf
```
